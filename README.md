Predicting stock prices is one of the challenges of the financial sector. Changes in stock prices can be influenced by economic or political influences of national and international governments. This complicates the strategic determination of buying and selling stocks.
The classical methods show their limitations related to inflexibility in volatility and complexity. The main problem with stock price forecasting is the difficulty of predicting, especially for long-term predicting.
Predicting stock price trends has attracted research from a variety of fields, such as economics, financial engineering, statistics, and machine learning.
## I. TOPIC OBJECTIVE
An algorithm is developed to predict stock prices under the influence of events, including the effect of the number of events and the short, medium and long-term effects. Starting from the classical algorithms based on regression models, recently, the machine learning approach is far ahead in terms of performance.
This study proposes a new way of accurately predicting stock prices in order to increase profits for users. By applying “Markov Decision Process”, or MDP, to model trend prediction. At any given time, the system will make a decision to choose an "Action" to achieve the greatest "Reward". The factor that creates the optimal and effective is the Reward function that will be proposed.
## II. RESEARCH METHODS
To do this, we used many different research methods such as:
  - Synthesize theoretical documents.
  - Building a general algorithm model.
  - Test under various conditions.
  - Optimization through each testing
## III. RESEARCH OBJECT AND SCOPE
Objects and scope of study: knowledge of Markov Decision Processing algorithm, knowledge of Machine Learning, knowledge of LSTM architecture, basic knowledge of stock trading market, knowledge of GOOGLE Colab tool to perform model building before and after applying the theory.
